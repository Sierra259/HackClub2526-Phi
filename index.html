    <p>This is a C6 - or sixth generation - Corvette. Suceeding the 1997-2004 C5, the 2005-2013 C6 was more a refinement of its predecessor than an attempt to reinvent America's Sports Car. Chevrolet's main goals with the C6 were to improve handling, weight, and make an overall more performant and comfortable car.</p>
    <p>
        To this extent, the C6 Corvette, at ~3220 pounds, sheds over 20 lbs from the C5, attaining a perfect 50-50 weight balance in the process. This gives the C6 a planted and balanced feel, which also further improves handling. The new LS2/LS3 engine in the C6 makes 400/430 horsepower (a unit of power for cars; a Honda Civic makes ~180 hp, a horse can manage 15 hp), a healthy bump up from the C5 LS1's 345 hp. The LS7 in the Z06 makes 505 hp, while the monstrous LS9 in the ZR1 boasts 638 hp.
